Whether you're a seasoned chef or a novice cook, cookbooks provide a convenient way to discover new recipes and plan delicious meals.</p>"},{"location":"mealie-doc/#recipe-organization","title":"Recipe Organization","text":"<p>Organizing Recipes</p> <p>Mealie has a robust and flexible recipe organization system with a few different ways to organize your recipes in a way that fits your household.</p> <p>Categories</p> <p>Categories are the overarching organizer for recipes. You can assign as many categories as you'd like to a recipe, but we recommend that you try to limit the categories you assign to a recipe to one or two.   This helps keep categories as focused as possible while still allowing you to find recipes that are related to each other.  For example, you might assign a recipe to the category Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Side.</p> <p>Tags</p> <p>Tags are nearly identical to categories in function but play a secondary role in some cases.   As such, we recommend that you use tags freely to help you organize your recipes by more specific topics.   For example, if a recipe can be frozen or is a great left-over meal, you could assign the tags frozen and   left-over and easily filter for those at a later time.</p> <p>Tools</p> <p>Tools are another way that some users like to organize their recipes. If a recipe requires some specific equipment,  it can be helpful to assign tools to the recipes. This is particularly useful for things that are less common,  like a pressure cooker or a sous vide.</p> <p>Did you know?</p> <p>Each of the above organizers can be filtered in searches and have their own pages where you can view all the recipes  that are associated with those organizers.</p> <p>Cookbooks</p> <p>Mealie also has the concept of cookbooks. These can be created inside of a group and can use a cross section of Categories, Tags, and  Tools to filter recipes and view them in one specific page. Cookbooks are a great way to keep a subset of recipes easily accessible  to you. You can think of them as a saved search results page. While most examples are simple, you can use as many organizers to  filter a cookbook as you'd like.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Main Courses: This cookbooks has all the recipes that have the Dinner category</li> <li>Pasta Sides: Recipes that have both the Side category and the Pasta tag</li> <li>Dessert Breads: Recipes that have both the Bread category and the Dessert tag</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"mealie-doc/#meal-planning-with-mealie","title":"Meal Planning with Mealie","text":"<p>Meal planning is a great way to save time, reduce food waste, and ensure you're eating balanced meals throughout the week.
